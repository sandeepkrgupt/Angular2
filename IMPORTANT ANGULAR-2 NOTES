1.  Properities i.e names inside  []  always starts from lower letter like [formGroup] but not [FormGroup].

2. Angular Properties must always binds with names starting with camel case i.e starting letter must be small.

3. All Modules which we are importing in app.module must also call or add in import[] array.

4. For using Form tag and Form Controls we must need to import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms' and call inside import[].

5. All Names starting with @ sign are called Decorators. Decorators contains the reference of any Class.

6. When we create custom services we need to import them at two Places - 
i. - > in app.module 
import {NewServiceName} from './serviveFolderName/serviceFileName.serve;
then call your New Service inside Prodivers: [] Array.
NOTE - ALWAYS SAVE SERVICE FILE AS filename.service.ts to easily identify service file and keep it inside service Folder.

ii. - > Then you also need to import in component.ts file
import {NewServiceName} from '../serviceFolderName/filename;
Then you need to store these services inside variable in constructor() function like this - 
constructor(private var_name : NewServiceName) {}

7. If you are creating multiple services and want to use them in one common service that you have created then you need to import them all 
inside that common service file and YOU ONLY NEED TO IMPORT THAT COMMOM SERVICE FILE INSIDE component.ts file.

8. CONSTRUCTOR -  Every class which is having it's own object is known as constructor or in other wors , A constructor is a special method of a class that
is initializes objects of its own type.

9. 'thi's operator is used to access the object of class itself. 

10. When we create Service object automatically gets created, so we need access the data members using this operator

11. In Factory we need to create object like - > var Obj = {};
